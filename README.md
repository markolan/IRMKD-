# IRMDK implemented with SSD
Forked from [PyTorch-SSD](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch), which is a [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of [Single Shot MultiBox Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) from the 2016 paper by Wei Liu, Dragomir Anguelov, Dumitru Erhan, Christian Szegedy, Scott Reed, Cheng-Yang, and Alexander C. Berg.  The official and original Caffe code can be found [here](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).

## Installation
- Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) by selecting your environment on the website and running the appropriate command.
- Clone this repository.
  * Note: We currently only support Python 3+.
- Then download the dataset by following the [instructions](#datasets) below.
- We now support [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) for real-time loss visualization during training!
  * To use Visdom in the browser:
  ```Shell
  # First install Python server and client
  pip install visdom
  # Start the server (probably in a screen or tmux)
  python -m visdom.server
  ```
  * Then (during training) navigate to http://localhost:8097/ (see the Train section below for training details).
- Note: For training, we currently support [VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) and [COCO](http://mscoco.org/), and aim to add [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) support soon.

## Datasets
To make things easy, we provide bash scripts to handle the dataset downloads and setup for you.  We also provide simple dataset loaders that inherit `torch.utils.data.Dataset`, making them fully compatible with the `torchvision.datasets` [API](http://pytorch.org/docs/torchvision/datasets.html).


### COCO
Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context

##### Download COCO 2014
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/COCO2014.sh
```

### VOC Dataset
PASCAL VOC: Visual Object Classes

##### Download VOC2007 trainval & test
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2007.sh # <directory>
```

##### Download VOC2012 trainval
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2012.sh # <directory>
```

## Training SSD
- First download the fc-reduced [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) PyTorch base network weights at:              https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
- By default, we assume you have downloaded the file in the `ssd.pytorch/weights` dir:

```Shell
mkdir weights
cd weights
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
```

- To train SSD using the train script simply specify the parameters listed in `train.py` as a flag or manually change them.

```Shell
python train.py
```

- Note:
  * For training, an NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended for speed.
  * For instructions on Visdom usage/installation, see the <a href='#installation'>Installation</a> section.
  * You can pick-up training from a checkpoint by specifying the path as one of the training parameters (again, see `train.py` for options)

## Evaluation
To evaluate a trained network:

```Shell
python eval.py
```

You can specify the parameters listed in the `eval.py` file by flagging them or manually changing them.
